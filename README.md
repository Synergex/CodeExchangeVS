**Additional Information:**
Note, this must be installed to C:\Development\ â€“ so that the folders C:\Development\CodeExchange and C:\Development\CodeExchangeVS are generated, as these are hard coded in the VS projects. Note: All submissions function on originally listed platforms. Disregard the Visual Studio project when on a non-Windows platform.

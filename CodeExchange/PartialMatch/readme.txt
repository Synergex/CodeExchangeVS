; README for PARTIALMATCH.DBL
;
; Description of function
; -----------------------
;
; This function will read a synergy isam file and count the number of
; records that match a partial key provided.  This function must be defined as
; a ^VAL function, and will return the count as the function return value.
;
; NOTE : please ensure the A_KEY is to correct lenght.  Trailing spaces may
; affect the count of matching records.
;
;
; A test program can be generated by defining BUILD_EXE
;
;
; NOTE : The READS uses a LOCK:Q_NO_TLOCK which does not reprobe the index
; before every read.  This is for performance reasons.  If used on a file that
; has a lot of stores or deletes, the use of Q_NO_TLOCK may provide an
; inaccurate count. For maximum reliabilty in heavily used files, use Q_NO_LOCK.

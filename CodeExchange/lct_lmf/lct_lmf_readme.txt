README.TXT for LCT_LMF.DBL

Description of functions
------------------------

These functions wrap the Synergy/DE Licensing Toolkit functions.  They
have the same parameters as the Synergy/DE Licensing Toolkit, but will
also work on OpenVMS, by using the OpenVMS License Management
Facility (LMF).  If you do not have the ability to generate OpenVMS
PAK's (i.e. generate your own licenses on OpenVMS), please contact
HP for further information.
